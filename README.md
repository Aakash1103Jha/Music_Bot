# Music Bot

A discord bot that can play music from as simple as a youtube link.

### How to use this bot?

- Fork from this repository, or download it as a zip file.
- Open `terminal` and `cd` into the project's root directory.
- Run `npm install` to get all the required dependencies.
- Create a `.env` file and add your bot's token/key in it. For what to name to use, check `server.js` where `client.login()` method is written.
- Once that is done, run `npm run bot` to get it up and running.
- All that is needed now is adding this bot to your own discord server.

### Enjoy!
